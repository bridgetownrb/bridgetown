* Bugfix: Resolve bug in converter error notifications

## 0.18.1 - 2020-10-29

* Bugfix: Use capture helper for liquid_render [#174](https://github.com/bridgetownrb/bridgetown/pull/174) ([jaredcwhite](https://github.com/jaredcwhite))

## 0.18.0 - 2020-10-29

* Configurable template engines on a per-site or per-document basis [#157](https://github.com/bridgetownrb/bridgetown/pull/157) ([jaredcwhite](https://github.com/jaredcwhite))
  * Set a `template_engine` key in your config file. The default is assumed to be liquid, but you can change it to `erb` (or other things in the future as this gets rolled out). Once that is set, you don't even have to name all your ERB files with an `.erb` extension—it will process even `.html.`, `.md`, `.json`, etc. It also means Liquid won't try to "preprocess" any ERB files, etc.
  * Regardless of what is configured site-wide, you can also set the `template_engine` in front matter (whether that's in an individual file or using front matter defaults), allowing you to swap out template engines wherever it's needed.
  * Front matter defaults support setting `template_engine` to none or anything else for a part of the source tree.
  * Liquid pages/layouts with a `.liquid` extension are processed as Liquid even if the configured engine is something else.
  * **Breaking change:** previously it was possible in Liquid for a child layout to set a front matter variable and a parent layout to access the child layout's variable value, aka `{{ layout.variable_from_child_layout }}`. That's no longer the case now…each layout has access to only its own front matter data.
  * **Breaking change:** a few pre-render hooks were provided access to Liquid's global payload hash. That meant they could alter the hash and thus the data being fed to Liquid templates. The problem is that there was no visibility into those changes from any other part of the system. Plugins accessing actual page/layout/site/etc. data wouldn't pick up those changes, nor would other template engines like ERB. Now if a hook needs to alter data, it needs to alter actual Ruby model data, and Liquid's payload should always reflect that model data.
* Add render method for Ruby templates [#169](https://github.com/bridgetownrb/bridgetown/pull/169) ([jaredcwhite](https://github.com/jaredcwhite))
  * Add Zeitwerk loaders for component folders (any `*.rb` file will now be accessible from Ruby templates). _Note:_ Zeitwerk will not load classes from plugins if they're already present in the source folder, so if you want a component to "reopen" a class from a plugin, you'll need to `require` the plugin class explicitly in your local component.
  * Allow ERB capture to pass object argument to its block.
  * **Breaking change:** the previous `<%|= output_block do %>…<%| end %>` block style is out in favor of: `<%= output_block do %>…<% end %>`, so you don't have to change a thing coming from Rails. _Note:_ if you're coming from Middleman where blocks output by default without `<%=`, you'll need to switch to Rails-style block expressions.
  * **Breaking change:** the `markdownify` helper in ERB now just returns a string rather than directly outputting to the template, so use `<%= markdownify do %>…<% end %>`.

## 0.11.0 - 2020-04-21

**Prototype Pages**

You can now create a page, say `categories/category.html`, and add a `prototype` config
to the Front Matter:

```yaml
layout: default
title: Posts in category :prototype-term
prototype:
  term: category
```

And then all the site's different categories will have archives pages at this location
(e.g. `categories/awesome-movies`, `categories/my-cool-vacation`, etc.) It enables
pagination automatically, so you'd just use `paginator.documents` to loop through the
posts. [See the docs here.](https://www.bridgetown.com/docs/prototype-pages)

[#11](https://github.com/bridgetownrb/bridgetown/pull/11)

## 0.10.2 - 2020-04-19

**Automatic Yarn Step for New Plugins**

Now with Gem-based plugins for Bridgetown, all you need to do is add `yarn-add`
metadata matching the NPM package name and keep the version the same as the Gem
version. For example:

```ruby
  spec.metadata = { "yarn-add" => "my-awesome-plugin@#{MyAwesomePlugin::VERSION}" }
```

With that bit of metadata, Bridgetown will know always to look for that package in
the users' `package.json` file when they load Bridgetown, and it will trigger a
`yarn add` command if the package and exact version number isn't present.

## 0.10.1 - 2020-04-18

Add `{% webpack_path [js|css] }` tag which pulls in the Webpack manifest and finds
the hashed output bundles. Also works in concert with the Watcher so every time
Webpack rebuilds the bundles, Bridgetown regenerates the site.

[#6](https://github.com/bridgetownrb/bridgetown/pull/6)

## 0.10.0 - 2020-04-17

**Switch gears on _experimental_ component functionality.**

Going with a new `rendercontent` tag instead of `component`. It is based on
Shopify's new Render tag which recently got introduced to Liquid. Note that the
feature hasn't been officially released via the Liquid gem, so we need to use the
main branch that's been forked on GitHub with a higher version number).

[#5](https://github.com/bridgetownrb/bridgetown/pull/5)

## 0.9.0 - 2020-04-16

  * Update table styling in Documentation
  * Now showing the plugins_dir in log output if it's present
  * With the Posts Reader changes, now you can add a Front Matter Default of
    `_posts/drafts` having `published: false`, put a bunch of draft posts in
    `_posts/drafts` and you're done!
  * New `-U` flag makes it easier to specify generating `published: false` docs.
  * The Posts Reader has been reworked so that files with valid front matter can
    be read in even if there's no YYYY-MM-DD- at the beginning. In addition, static
    files are also supported, which means if you can create a folder (`inlinefiles`),
    drop a post in along with a bunch of images, and use `![alt](some-image.jpg)`
    relative paths, it'll work! Big improvement to Markdown authoring. (You'll need
    to use a permalink in a specific manner though, e.g.
    `permalink: /inlinefiles/:title:output_ext`)
    If you need a static file not to get copied to the destination, just add an
    `_` at the beginning and it'll get ignored.
  * Collections no longer allow displaying a full server file path via Liquid.
  * `{{ page.collection }}` now returns a CollectionDrop, not the label of
    the collection. Using the `jsonify` filter on a document however still returns
    just the label for the `collection` key.
  * Add favicon to website
  * Add mobile improvements to website
  * Add back working feature tests for basic pagination
  * Convert to Ruby 1.9+ `symbol: value` hash syntax
  * Add [Swup](https://swup.js.org) to website for some slick transitions
  * Add "where_query" feature to Paginate. For example. specify `where_query: [author, sandy]` in the pagination YAML to filter by that front matter key.
  * Update the Jamstack page in the docs.

## 0.8.1 - 2020-04-14

    that's accessible via `{{ site.metadata.title }}` (for example)
  * Add relevant changes to site template for `bridgetown new`
  * Continue work on repo cleanup and documentation

## 0.6.0 - 2020-04-09

  * Add `bridgetown console` command to invoke IRB with the current site (similar to the Rails console command). Plugins, gems, will be loaded, etc.

  * Remove `em-websocket` dependency.
  * Change _config.yml to bridgetown.config.yml (but _config.yml will still work for compatibility purposes).

## 0.4.0 - 2020-04-05

  * Added a `component` Liquid tag which extends the functionality of include tags.
  * Added a new `bridgetown-website` project to the repo, which of course is a Bridgetown site and will house the homepage, documentation, etc.

## 0.3.0 - 2020-04-05

  * Moved all Bridgetown code to `bridgetown-core`, the idea being this will now be a monorepo housing Core plus a few other official gems/projects as time goes on. Users will install the `bridgetown` gem which in turns installs `bridgetown-core` as a dependency.

## 0.2.0 - 2020-04-04

  * Completed comprehensive code audio and changed or removed features no
    longer required for the project. Fixed and successfully ran test suite
    accordingly.

## 0.1.0 - 2020-04-02

  * First version after fork from pre-released Jekyll 4.1
