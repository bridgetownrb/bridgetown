# GOVERNANCE.md

This file documents Bridgetown's governance model. It is meant for all users, but particularly for:

- users who are considering Bridgetown and need more clarity on the people and companies behind it;
- new contributors who want to understand who's in charge of reviewing and merging their code;
- existing contributors who would like to apply for the Core Team.

## Project Director

At present, [Whitefusion](https://www.whitefusion.studio) is the main code contributor and director of Bridgetown.
They provide technical guidance and coordinate community efforts and activities.

## Core Team

The Core Team is a group of individuals who are committed to maintaining the project from a
technical perspective for the long term. Their main goal is to continuously deliver value to the
community through their work and the work of all contributors.

Here are some of the tasks they are responsible for:

- implementing new features;
- identifying and fixing bugs;
- triaging issues;
- reviewing and merging pull requests;
- providing support via [Discord chat](https://discord.gg/4E6hktQGz4), [Discussions on GitHub](https://github.com/bridgetownrb/bridgetown/discussions), and other channels;
- improving the documentation;
- providing technical feedback and guidance to contributors;
- coordinating the work of contributors;
- maintaining the code, documentation and tools.

We understand that not all members will be able to dedicate the same amount of time to Bridgetown: this
is absolutely okay, since Bridgetown is an open source project and most of the work is done on a
volunteer basis. With that said, a minimum time investment is expected out of Core Team members.

### Joining the Core Team

New Core Team members are appointed by the Core Team.

To apply for the Core Team, you must be proposed by an existing member.

If you don't know anyone, simply send a DM to **Jared White** in [Discord](https://discord.gg/4E6hktQGz4), explaining
why you think you should be in the Core Team and what kind of contribution you expect to bring.

### Leaving the Core Team

To leave the Core Team, simply communicate your decision to the other Core Team members via DM or email.

## Stakeholders

Stakeholders are members of the Bridgetown community who have a strong interest in the future of
Bridgetown. This group includes retailers, agencies and long-term friends of the project.

They coordinate and contribute to Bridgetown usually in non-technical ways, for instance by choosing
what conferences to attend or organize, by identifying marketing opportunities or by deciding how
to use donated funds to support the Bridgetown project.

### Joining the stakeholders

To join the stakeholders, you must contribute significantly to Bridgetown from either a financial or
technical standpoint (or both!).

You must be nominated by an existing stakeholder. If you don't know anyone, send a DM to Jared White to request membership, explaining how you have contributed to Bridgetown and what value
you can bring to the stakeholders.

Your request must be approved by 2/3rds of the existing stakeholders for you to become a member.

### Leaving the stakeholders

To leave the stakeholders, simply announce your decision by DM or email.
