Feature: Post excerpts
  As a hacker who likes to blog
  I want to be able to make a static site
  In order to share my awesome ideas with the interwebs
  But some people can only focus for a few moments
  So just give them a taste

  Scenario: An excerpt without a layout
    Given I have an "index.html" page that contains "{% for post in site.posts %}{{ post.excerpt }}{% endfor %}"
    And I have a _posts directory
    And I have the following posts:
      | title  | date       | layout | content             |
      | entry1 | 2007-12-31 | post   | content for entry1. |
    When I run bridgetown build
    Then I should get a zero exit status
    And the output directory should exist
    And I should see exactly "<p>content for entry1.</p>" in "output/index.html"

  Scenario: An excerpt from a post with a layout
    Given I have an "index.html" page that contains "{% for post in site.posts %}{{ post.excerpt }}{% endfor %}"
    And I have a _posts directory
    And I have a _layouts directory
    And I have a post layout that contains "{{ page.excerpt }}"
    And I have the following posts:
      | title  | date       | layout | content             |
      | entry1 | 2007-12-31 | post   | content for entry1. |
    When I run bridgetown build
    Then I should get a zero exit status
    And the output directory should exist
    And the output/2007 directory should exist
    And the output/2007/12 directory should exist
    And the output/2007/12/31 directory should exist
    And the "output/2007/12/31/entry1.html" file should exist
    And I should see exactly "<p>content for entry1.</p>" in "output/2007/12/31/entry1.html"
    And I should see exactly "<p>content for entry1.</p>" in "output/index.html"

  Scenario: An excerpt with Liquid constructs from a post with a layout
    Given I have an "index.html" page that contains "{% for post in site.posts %}{{ post.excerpt }}{% endfor %}"
    And I have a configuration file with "baseurl" set to "/blog"
    And I have a _posts directory
    And I have a _layouts directory
    And I have a post layout that contains "{{ page.excerpt }}"
    And I have the following posts:
      | title  | date       | layout | content                                  |
      | entry1 | 2007-12-31 | post   | {{ 'assets/style.css' \| relative_url }} |
    When I run bridgetown build
    Then I should get a zero exit status
    And the output directory should exist
    And the output/2007 directory should exist
    And the output/2007/12 directory should exist
    And the output/2007/12/31 directory should exist
    And the "output/2007/12/31/entry1.html" file should exist
    And I should see exactly "<p>/blog/assets/style.css</p>" in "output/2007/12/31/entry1.html"
    And I should see exactly "<p>/blog/assets/style.css</p>" in "output/index.html"

  Scenario: An excerpt from a post with a layout which has context
    Given I have an "index.html" page that contains "{% for post in site.posts %}{{ post.excerpt }}{% endfor %}"

      | Unrendered Post | post   | false              | 2017-07-06 | Liquid is not rendered at {{ page.url }} |
      | Rendered Post   | post   | true               | 2017-07-06 | Liquid is rendered at {{ page.url }}     |
