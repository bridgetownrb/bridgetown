# Hello! This is where you manage which Bridgetown version is used to run.
# When you want to use a different version, change it below, save the
# file and run `bundle install`. Run Bridgetown with `bundle exec`, like so:
#
#   bundle exec bridgetown serve
#
# This will help ensure the proper Bridgetown version is running.
#
# To install a plugin, simply run bundle add and specify the group
# "bridgetown_plugins". For example:
#
#   bundle add some-new-plugin -g bridgetown_plugins
#
# Happy Bridgetowning!

gem "bridgetown", "~> <%= Bridgetown::VERSION %>"

# Puma is a Rack-compatible server
# (you can optionally limit this to the "development" group)
