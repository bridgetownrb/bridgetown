# Welcome to your project's Gemfile, used by Rubygems & Bundler.
#
# To install a plugin, run:
#
#   bundle add new-plugin-name -g bridgetown_plugins
#
# This will ensure the plugin is added to the correct Bundler group.
#
# When you run Bridgetown commands, we recommend using a binstub like so:
#
#   bin/bridgetown start (or console, etc.)
#
# This will help ensure the proper Bridgetown version is running.
####

# If you need to upgrade/switch Bridgetown versions, change the line below
# and then run `bundle update bridgetown`
gem "bridgetown", "~> <%= Bridgetown::VERSION %>"

# Uncomment to add file-based dynamic routing to your project:
# gem "bridgetown-routes", "~> <%= Bridgetown::VERSION %>"

# Puma is a Rack-compatible server used by Bridgetown
# (you can optionally limit this to the "development" group)
gem "puma", "~> 5.5"
