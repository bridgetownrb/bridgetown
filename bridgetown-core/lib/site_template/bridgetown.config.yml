# Welcome to Bridgetown!

# This config file is for settings that affect your whole site, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec bridgetown serve'. If you change this file, please restart the
# server process.
#
# For reloadable site metadata like title, SEO description, social media
# handles, etc., take a look at src/_data/site_metadata.yml
