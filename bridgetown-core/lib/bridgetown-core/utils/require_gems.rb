              Yikes! It looks like you don't have #{name} or one of its dependencies installed.
              In order to use Bridgetown as currently configured, you'll need to install this gem.

              If you've run Bridgetown with `bundle exec`, ensure that you have included the #{name}
              gem in your Gemfile as well.

              The full error message from Ruby is: '#{e.message}'
