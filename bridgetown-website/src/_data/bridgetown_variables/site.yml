- name: site.url

    Contains the url of your site as it is configured in the <code>bridgetown.config.yml</code>.
    For example, if you have <code>url: http://mysite.com</code> in your configuration file,
    then it will be accessible in Liquid as <code>site.url</code>. For the <code>development</code>
    environment there is an
    exception: <code>site.url</code> will be set to the value of <code>host</code>, <code>port</code>,
    and SSL-related options. This defaults to <code>url: http://localhost:4000</code>.
- name: "site.metadata"
  description: >-
    You can put metadata variables in <code>_data/site_metadata.yml</code> so
    they'll be easy to access and will regenerate pages when changed. This is a
    good place to put <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> content like site title,
    description, icon, social media handles, etc. Then you can reference
    {{ site.metadata.title }}, etc. in your Liquid templates.
- name: "site.[CONFIGURATION_DATA]"
  description: >-
    All the variables set via the command line and your <code>bridgetown.config.yml</code> are available
    through the <code>site</code> variable. For example, if you have <code>foo: bar</code> in
    your configuration file, then it will be accessible in Liquid as <code>site.foo</code>.
    Bridgetown does not parse changes to <code>bridgetown.config.yml</code> in
    <code>watch</code> mode, you must restart Bridgetown to see changes to variables.
