## Install Node and Yarn

Node is a JavaScript runtime that can execute on a server or development machine. Yarn
is a package manager for Node packages. You'll need Node and Yarn in order to install
and use Webpack, the frontend asset compiler that runs alongside Bridgetown.

```shell
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt remove cmdtest # this is so we can install Yarn
curl -sS https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/ stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yarn.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs yarn
```
