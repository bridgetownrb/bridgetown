## Install Node and Yarn

Node is a Javascript runtime that can execute on a server or development machine. Yarn
is a package manager for Node packages. You'll need Node and Yarn in order to install
and use Webpack, the frontend asset compiler that runs alongside Bridgetown. Yarn is also used along with Concurrently and Browsersync to spin up a live-reload development
server.
