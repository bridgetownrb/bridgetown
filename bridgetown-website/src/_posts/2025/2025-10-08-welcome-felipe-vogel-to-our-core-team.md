We've very excited to announce that **Felipe Vogel** has joined the Bridgetown Core Team! Felipe is a developer based in Lexington, Kentucky, and originally hails from Brazil. He has been an enthusiastic user of Bridgetown for a long time now. In factâ€¦

â€¦When Felipe was first learning Ruby, Bridgetown was the first Ruby web framework that he picked up. Eventually he got into Rails and other tools as well, but that's quite an amazing story. Here are a few other [fun facts about Felipe from his website](https://fpsvogel.com):

* "**I used to be a humanities teacher** in a former career that took me all the way to West Africa."
* "**I grew up in Brazil** in southern Amazonia, at times living with the Jarawara indigenous people, in a village that you can see on Google Maps."
* "**Iâ€™m a big Latin nerd.** In grad school I took most of my classes in Latin and lived in the unofficial _domus Latina_ (Latin house), where we spoke only Latin except when we had guestsâ€¦ which, as you might guess, was rare ðŸ˜‚"

You'll start to see Felipe a bit more in our [Discord chat](https://discord.gg/4E6hktQGz4), taking a peek at new PRs, and in other community endeavors. You can also find Felipe in the fediverse: [@fpsvogel@ruby.social](https://ruby.social/@fpsvogel). We're glad to have Felipe aboard the USSG Bridgetown! ðŸ«¡
