This year has been a pivotal one for the **Bridgetown web framework**. We started off 2024 on some conceptual shaky ground, uncertain about the direction Bridgetown should head in next, but over the spring and summer we really hit our stride and are finishing out the year in a strong position.

Another meaty beta release of Bridgetown 2.0 is just around the corner, and we expect the final Bridgetown v2 production release to land in early Q1 2025—unlocking a new wave of innovation in the Ruby-powered web development space.

Our message for 2025 is a simple one: Bridgetown is ready to be **your #1 go-to framework** for ambitious small-to-midsize web applications. We’re not just for blogs. We’re not just for marketing pages. We’re for powerful, database-driven, interactive software across a variety of industries and use cases. We’re flipping the script: instead of asking “why Bridgetown?” you’ll be asking “why not?”

**Some stats for Bridgetown in 2024:**

* 6 releases, 3 in the 2.0 beta line
* 15 contributors across all the releases
* Grew by roughly 200 stars on [GitHub](https://github.com/bridgetownrb/bridgetown)
* 574 members in [Discord](https://discord.gg/4E6hktQGz4)
* 409 followers on [Mastodon](https://ruby.social/@bridgetown)
* And now we’re on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/bridgetownrb.com) too!

We’ll have a slew of exciting announcements to make about the broader Bridgetown ecosystem in 2025 as v2 heads out the door, so be sure to subscribe and join in all the right places. If you’ve been thinking to yourself “somebody really needs to shake up the Ruby landscape with a fresh vision for how web applications are architected and deployed—and how to strengthen the open source community with safety and inclusiveness” — don’t worry, we’ve got some good stuff cooking.

In the meantime, we thank you for your continued interest and support of the Bridgetown project and want to wish you a very **Happy New Year**! _Go Ruby!_
