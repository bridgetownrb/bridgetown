Built upon proven open source technology, **Bridgetown** is a _fast_, _scalable_, _modular_, and _thoroughly forward-looking_ framework for building websites and frontend applications.

* **Write Content.**{:.is-size-5.has-text-brown} &nbsp;Content in Bridgetown is simply text files in your repository. Write flexible **Markdown** and use sophisticated **Liquid** tags to enhance your presentation and functionality. Using a headless CMS or third-party APIs? That works too!

* **Design with Components.**{:.is-size-5.has-text-brown} &nbsp;Encapsulate common building-blocks of your design which can be reused across multiple pages and contexts or displayed in an always up-to-date style guide. _(experimental; coming soon)_

* **Customize with Plugins.**{:.is-size-5.has-text-brown} &nbsp;Write your own plugins in the delightful Ruby programming language to facilitate totally custom projects, or simply add community gems to supercharge your site build.

* **Add a Modern Frontend.**{:.is-size-5.has-text-brown} &nbsp;Bridgetown comes with support for **Webpack** out-of-the-box, which means you can add Javascript frameworks like **React**, **Vue**, **Stimulus** as well as CSS frameworks like **Bulma** or **Tailwind** to get a leg up fast.

* **Deploy Anywhere.**{:.is-size-5.has-text-brown} &nbsp;Use an automated hosting service like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) to deploy your site upon every update, or just sync the `output` folder to a standard web server and you're done. It's without a doubt the most flexible publishing system available.
