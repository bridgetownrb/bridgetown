Have fun! ðŸ˜ƒ

## Ways to Contribute

Whether you're a developer, designer, or overall Bridgetown enthusiast, there are lots of ways to contribute to our open source project. Here's a few ideas:

* Comment on some of the project's [open issues](https://github.com/{{ site.metadata.github }}/issues). Have you experienced the same problem? Know a work around? Do you have a suggestion for how the feature could be better?
* Read through the [documentation](/docs/) and file a pull request (PR) by forking the [Bridgetown repo on GitHub](https://github.com/{{ site.metadata.github }}/fork) and adding your changes or suggestions for something that could be improved.
* Browse through the latest [chat room activity](https://discord.gg/4E6hktQGz4) and lend a hand answering questions or proposing awesome new features. There's a good chance other folks are in the same boat as you.
* Help evaluate [open pull requests](https://github.com/{{ site.metadata.github }}/pulls) by testing the changes locally and reviewing what's proposed. Or if you [have a PR you'd like to submit](https://github.com/bridgetownrb/bridgetown/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for a new feature or a bugfix, we'd be thrilled to evaluate it and guide it through the release cycle if it adheres to our [project goals](/docs/philosophy/).
