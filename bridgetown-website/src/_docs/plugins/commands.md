Bridgetown plugins can provide commands for the `bridgetown` executable.

Commands are built using the [Thor](https://github.com/erikhuda/thor) CLI
toolkit, which powers many popular Ruby libraries and frameworks including
Rails, Bundler, and Middleman.

{%@ Note type: :warning do %}
  In Bridgetown 1.2, plugin gems which provide new commands won't work unless they're required within a boot file (aka `config/boot.rb`). This is likely to change in a future version of Bridgetown. In the meantime, you'll want to clarify that fact in your plugin gem's README. [More information is available here.](/docs/configuration/initializers#low-level-boot-customization)
{% end %}

Simply subclass `Thor` in your plugin and use a registration block to notify
Bridgetown how to include your command. Commands are written in a `command [subcommand]`
format, so if your base command is `river`, your logic will be contained
within one or more subcommands:

```
bridgetown river # outputs a help message about the available subcommands
bridgetown river bank
bridgetown river flows
```

You can also use the `ConfigurationOverridable` concern to load the
`bridgetown.config.yml` configuration and optionally override keys with
command line options passed to your command.

Here's an example of how to write a `Thor` subclass:

```ruby
require_all "bridgetown-core/commands/concerns"

module MyPlugin
  module Commands
    class River < Thor
      include Bridgetown::Commands::ConfigurationOverridable

      Bridgetown::Commands::Registrations.register do
        desc "river <command>", "Take me to the river"
        subcommand "river", River
      end

      desc "bank", "Walk along the river bank"
      def bank
        puts "Out for a stroll..."
      end

      desc "flow", "Old man river, he just keeps on rolling along"
      option :destination, desc: "Override configuration file destination"
      def flow
        config = configuration_with_overrides(options)
        destination = config["destination"]

        puts "Flowing to your destination: #{destination}"
      end
    end
  end
end
```

In addition, if you want full access to [automations](/docs/automations) from
within your command, you can include the Thor and custom Bridgetown actions:

```ruby
include Thor::Actions
include Bridgetown::Commands::Actions
```

Then your command can use Thor actions:

```ruby
say_status :river, "Go with the flow! :)"
```
