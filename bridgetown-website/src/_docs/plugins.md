Plugins allow you to extend Bridgetown's behavior to fit your needs. You can
write plugins yourself directly in your website codebase, or install gem-based
plugins and [themes](/docs/themes) for a limitless source of new features and
capabilities.

Be sure to
[check out our growing list of official and third-party plugins](/plugins/)
for ways to jazz up your website.

Whenever you need more information about the plugins installed on your site and what they're doing, you can use the `bridgetown plugins list` command. You can also copy content out of gem-based plugins with the `bridgetown plugins cd` command. [Read the command reference for further details.](/docs/commands/plugins)

  #### Turn Your Plugins into Gems

  If you'd like to maintain plugin separation from your site source code,
  share functionality across multiple projects, and manage dependencies,
  you can create a Ruby gem for private or public distribution. This is also
  how you'd create a [Bridgetown theme](/docs/themes).

## Setup

There are three methods of adding plugins to your site build.

1. In your site's root folder (aka where your config file lives), make a `plugins` folder. Write your custom plugins and save them here. Any file ending in `.rb` inside this folder will be loaded automatically before Bridgetown generates your site.

2. Add gem-based plugins to the `bridgetown_plugins` Bundler group in your `Gemfile` by running a command such as:
  ```sh
bundle add bridgetown-feed -g bridgetown_plugins
  ```

3. Running an [automation](/docs/automations) which will install one or more
gems along with other set up and configuration:
  ```sh
bin/bridgetown apply https://github.com/bridgetownrb/bridgetown-cloudinary
  ```

## Introduction to the Builder API

The Builder API (also sometimes referred to as the Unified Plugins API) is our preferred method of writing plugins for both custom plugins as well as gem-based plugins. Previous techniques of writing plugins (registering Liquid tags and filters, generators, etc.) are known as the Legacy API. This API isn't going away any time soon as it provides the underlying functionality for the Builder API. However, we recommend all new plugin development center around the Builder API going forward.

### Local Custom Plugins

The `SiteBuilder` class in your `plugins` folder provides the a superclass you can inherit from to create a new builder. In `plugins/builders`, you can create one or more subclasses of `SiteBuilder` and write your plugin code within the `build` method which is called automatically by Bridgetown early on in the build process (specifically during the `pre_read` event before content has been loaded from the file system).

```ruby
# plugins/builders/add_some_tags.rb
class Builders::AddSomeTags < SiteBuilder
  def build
    liquid_tag "cool_stuff", :cool_tag
  end

  def cool_tag(attributes, tag)
    "This is so cool!"
  end
end
```

Builders provide a couple of instance methods you can use to reference important data during the build process: `site` and `config`.

So for example you could add data with a generator:

```ruby
class Builders::AddNewData < SiteBuilder
  def build
    generator do
      site.data[:new_data] = {new: "New stuff"}
    end
  end
end
```

And then reference that data in any Liquid template:

```Liquid
{% raw %}{{ site.data.new_data.new }}{% endraw %}

  output: New stuff
```

### Default Configurations

The `config` instance method is available to access the Bridgetown site configuration object, and along with that you can optionally define a default configuration that will be included in the config objectâ€”and can be overridden by config settings directly in `bridgetown.config.yml`. For example:

```ruby
class Builders::BuilderWithConfiguration < SiteBuilder
  CONFIG_DEFAULTS = {
    custom_config: {
      my_setting: 123
    }
  }

  def build
    p config[:my_setting] # 123

    # now add this to bridgetown.config.yml:
    # custom_config:
    #   my_setting: "one two three"

    p config[:my_setting] # "one two three"
  end
end
```

### Gem-based Plugins

For a gem-based plugin, all you have to do is subclass directly from `Bridgetown::Builder` and then use the `register` class method to register the builder with Bridgetown when the plugin loads. Example:

```ruby
module Bridgetown
  module MyNiftyPlugin
    class Builder < Bridgetown::Builder
      CONFIG_DEFAULTS = {
        my_nifty_plugin: {
          this_goes_to_11: true
        }
      }

      def build
        this_goes_to = config[:my_nifty_plugin][:this_goes_to_11]
        # do other groovy things
      end
    end
  end
end

Bridgetown::MyNiftyPlugin::Builder.register
```

## Internal Ruby API

When writing a plugin for Bridgetown, you may sometimes be interacting with
the internal Ruby API. Objects like `Bridgetown::Site`, `Bridgetown::Resource::Base`, `Bridgetown::GeneratedPage`, etc. Other times you may be interacting with Liquid Drops, which are "safe" representations of the internal Ruby API for use in Liquid templates.

Documentation on the internal Ruby API for Bridgetown is forthcoming, but meanwhile, the simplest way to debug the code you write is to run `bridgetown console` and interact with the API there. Then you can copy working code into your plugin.

## Plugin Categories

There are several categories of functionality you can add to your Bridgetown plugin:

### [Tags](/docs/plugins/tags)

Create custom Liquid tags or "shortcodes" which you can add to your content or design templates. 

### [Filters](/docs/plugins/filters)

Provide custom Liquid filters to help transform data and content.

### [Helpers](/docs/plugins/helpers)

For Ruby-based templates such as ERB, Serbea, etc., you can provide custom helpers which can be called from your templates.

### [HTTP Requests and the Resource Builder](/docs/plugins/external-apis)

Easily pull data in from external APIs, and use a special DSL (Domain-Specific Language) to build resources out of that data.

### [Hooks](/docs/plugins/hooks)

Hooks provide fine-grained control to trigger custom functionality at various points in the build process.

### [HTML & XML Inspectors](/docs/plugins/inspectors)

Post-process the HTML or XML output of resources using the Nokogiri Ruby gem and its DOM-like API.

### [Generators](/docs/plugins/generators)

Generators allow you to automate the creating or updating of content in your site using Bridgetown's internal Ruby API.

### [Commands](/docs/plugins/commands)

Commands extend the `bridgetown` executable using the Thor CLI toolkit.

### [Converters](/docs/plugins/converters)

Converters change a markup language from one format to another.

#### Priority Flag

You can configure a plugin (builders, converters, etc.) with a specific `priority` flag. This flag determines what order the plugin is loaded in.

The default priority is `:normal`. Valid values are:

<code>:lowest</code>, <code>:low</code>, <code>:normal</code>, <code>:high</code>, and <code>:highest</code>.
Highest priority plugins are run first, lowest priority are run last.

Examples of specifying this flag:

```ruby
class Builders::DoImportantStuff < SiteBuilder
  priority :highest

  def build
    # do really important stuff here
  end
end

class Builders::CanWaitUntilLater < SiteBuilder
  priority :low

  def build
    # stuff that'll get run later (after the really important stuff)
  end
end
```

## Cache API

Bridgetown features a [Caching API](/docs/plugins/cache-api) which is used both internally as well as exposed for plugins and components. It can be used to cache the output of deterministic functions to speed up site generation.

## Zeitwerk and Autoloading

Bridgetown 1.0 brings with it a new autoloading mechanism using [Zeitwerk](https://github.com/fxn/zeitwerk), the same code loader used by Rails and many other Ruby-based projects. Zeitwerk uses a specific naming convension so the paths of your Ruby files and the namespaces/modules/classes of your Ruby code are aligned. For example:

```
plugins/my_plugin.rb         -> MyPlugin
plugins/my_plugin/foo.rb     -> MyPlugin::Foo
plugins/my_plugin/bar_baz.rb -> MyPlugin::BarBaz
plugins/my_plugin/woo/zoo.rb -> MyPlugin::Woo::Zoo
```

You can read more about [Zeitwerk's file conventions here](https://github.com/fxn/zeitwerk#file-structure).

{%@ Note do %}
  #### Take Me Back
  If you run into any problems with Zeitwerk after upgrading your Bridgetown project from pre-1.0, you can switch to the previous plugin loading method by adding `plugins_use_zeitwerk: false` to your `bridgetown.config.yml`. Or you can try using the `autoloader_collapsed_paths` setting as described below.
{% end %}

In addition to the `plugins` folder provided by default, **you can add your own folders** with autoloading support! Simply add to the `autoload_paths` setting in your config YAML:

```yaml
autoload_paths:
  - loadme
```

Now any Ruby file in your project's `./loadme` folder will be autoloaded. By default, files in your custom folders not "eager loaded", meaning that the Ruby code isn't actually processed unless/until you access the class or module name of the file somewhere in your code elsewhere. This can improve performance in certain cases. However, if you need to rely on the fact that your Ruby code is always loaded when the site is instantiated, simply set `eager` to true in your config:

```yaml
autoload_paths:
  - path: loadme
    eager: true
```

There may be times when you want to bypass Zeitwerk's default folder-based namespacing. For example, if you wanted something like this:

```
plugins/builders/tags.rb   -> Builders::Tags
plugins/helpers/hashify.rb -> Hashify
```

where the files in `builders` use a `Builders` namespace, but the files in `helpers` don't use a `Helpers` namespace, you can use the `autoloader_collapsed_paths` setting:

```yaml
autoloader_collapsed_paths:
  - plugins/helpers
```

And if you don't want namespacing for _any_ subfolders, you can use a glob pattern:

```yaml
autoloader_collapsed_paths:
  - top_level/*
```

Thus no files directly in `top_level` as well as any of its immediate subfolders will be namespaced (that is, no `TopLevel` module will be implied).

## Creating a Gem

The `bridgetown plugins new NAME` command will create an entire gem scaffold
for you to customize and publish to the [RubyGems.org](https://rubyplugins.org)
and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) registries. This is a great way to provide
[themes](/docs/themes), builders, and other sorts of add-on functionality to
Bridgetown websites. You'll want to make sure you update the `gemspec`,
`package.json`, `README.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md` files as you work on your
plugin to ensure all the necessary metadata and user documentation is present
and accounted for.

Make sure you [follow these instructions](/docs/plugins/gems-and-frontend/) to integrate your plugin's frontend code with the users' esbuild or Webpack setup. Also read up on [Source Manifests](/docs/plugins/source-manifests/) if you have layouts, components, resources, static files, and other content you would like your plugin to provide.

You can also provide an automation via your plugin's GitHub repository by adding
`bridgetown.automation.rb` to the root of your repo. This is a great way to
provide advanced and interactive setup for your plugin. [More information on
automations here.](/docs/automations)

When you're ready, publish your plugin gem to the [RubyGems.org](https://rubyplugins.org)
and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) registries. There are instructions on how to
do so in the sample README that is present in your new plugin folder under the
heading **Releasing**. Of course you will also need to make sure you've uploaded
your plugin to [GitHub](https://github.com) so it can be included in our
[Plugin Directory](/plugins/) and discovered by Bridgetown site owners far and
wide. Plus it's a great way to solicit feedback and improvements in the form
of open source code collaboration and discussion.

As always, if you have any questions or need support in creating your plugin,
[check out our community resources](/community).

  #### Testing Your Plugin

  As you author your plugin, you'll need a way to _use_ the gem within a live
  Bridgetown site. The easiest way to do that is to use a relative local path in
  the test site's `Gemfile`.

  ```ruby
  gem "my-plugin", :path => "../my-plugin", :group => :bridgetown_plugins
  ```

  You would do something similar in your test site's `package.json` as well (be sure to run [yarn link](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/link) so Yarn knows not to install your local path into `node_modules`):

  ```json
  "dependencies": {
    "random-js-package": "2.4.6",
    "my-plugin": "../my-plugin"
  }
  ```

  You may need to restart your server at times to pick up changes you make
  to your plugin (unfortunately hot-reload doesn't always work with gem-based plugins).

  Finally, you should try writing some [tests](http://docs.seattlerb.org/minitest/)
  in the `test` folder of your plugin. These tests could ensure your tags, filters,
  and other content are working as expected and won't break in the future as code
  gets updated.
