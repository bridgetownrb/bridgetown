Bridgetown gives you a lot of flexibility to customize how it builds your site. These options can be specified in a `bridgetown.config.yml` file placed in your siteâ€™s root folder or in certain cases can be specified as flags for the `bridgetown` executable in the terminal. You can also add many configuration options to the initializers file, including instantiating plugins and defining different values based on execution context (static builds vs. server rendering for example)

* [Initializers](/docs/configuration/initializers)
* [Configuration Options](/docs/configuration/options)
* [Environments](/docs/configuration/environments)
* [Markdown Options](/docs/configuration/markdown)
* [Liquid Options](/docs/configuration/liquid)
* Puma Configuration (_docs coming soon_)

Most of the ways you'll enhance and extend your site however is through writing [plugins](/docs/plugins). Continue reading for information on how to get started writing your first plugin or installing third-party plugins.
