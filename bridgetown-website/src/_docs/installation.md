Bridgetown is software written in Ruby, a friendly programming language that maximizes programmer happiness and makes it easy to build and customize open source projects. You will need to install Bridgetown as a Gem after you set up your Ruby language environment. You will also need to install Node and Yarn to manage your website's frontend assets.
