Running an automated test suite after your Bridgetown site has been built is a great way to ensure important content is available and formatted as you expect, and that some recent change hasn't broken anything critical within your build process.

## Use Ruby and Minitest to Test HTML Directly

Bridgetown provides a [bundled configuration](/docs/bundled-configurations#automated-test-suite-using-minitest) to add gems for [Minitest](https://docs.seattlerb.org/minitest/) and [Rack::Test](https://github.com/rack/rack-test) and set up the test environment in the `test` folder.

To install, run the following command:

```sh
bin/bridgetown configure minitesting
```

You can write tests to verify the output of both static and dynamic routes. Right when the test suite first runs, the Bridgetown site will be built (via the `test` [environment](/docs/configuration/environments)) so that static pages are available. Then, the [Roda server application](/docs/routes) will boot up in memory and you can make direct requests much as if you were using a full HTTP server.

The `html` and `json` helpers let you parse responses, either as a [Nokolexbor](https://github.com/serpapi/nokolexbor) document in the case of an HTML response, or `JSON.parse` in the case of a JSON response.

Here's an example of such a test:

```ruby
require "minitest_helper"

class TestBlog < Bridgetown::Test
  def test_authors
    html get "/blog"

    assert_equal '<img src="/images/khristi-jamil-avatar.jpg" alt="Khristi Jamil" class="avatar">',
                 document.query_selector_all(".box .author img").last.outer_html
  end
end
```

There are `get`, `post`, and `delete` methods available for testing various server routes. For more information, read the [Rack::Test](https://github.com/rack/rack-test) documentation. You can also access the Bridgetown site object loaded in memory via the `site` helper. For example, `site.metadata.title` would return your site's title as defined in `_data/site_metadata.yml`.

You can add additional tests via `test_*` methods, and you can create as many test files as you want to handle various parts of the site. Be advised that these tests are run via the `server` initialization context, so it's possible something may not have run as you would expect under a `static` initialization context. But since the static site is already built prior to your tests being executed, it's probably best for you to test static use cases via the output HTML.

The `Bridgetown::Test` class also includes support for spec-style blocks (`describe`, `it`, etc.) as well as expectations (`expect(x).must_equal(y)`, etc.), so you can use whatever style you feel comfortable with when writing your tests. [Here's a cheat sheet with a list of assertions/expectations](https://www.fullstackruby.dev/cheat-sheets/minitest) provided by Minitest.

Methods you can override in a `Bridgetown::Test` subclass:

* `roda_app_class` - default return value is `RodaApp`
* `roda_log_level` - default return value is `Logger::WARN` (if you want to see all server logs when running tests, return `Logger::INFO` or `Logger::DEBUG` instead)

## Headless Browser Testing with Cypress

You can install Cypress using a [bundled configuration](/docs/bundled-configurations):

```sh
bin/bridgetown configure cypress
```

The above command will add a `cypress/` directory to your project. Within this directory you can see the `integration/navbar.spec.js` file as an example of how to write your tests.

The test suite can be run using:

```sh
bin/bridgetown cy:test:ci
```

A number of other useful commands are also installed along with Cypress:

```sh
# Opens the Cypress test runner.
bin/bridgetown cy:open

# Starts the Bridgetown server and opens the Cypress test runner.
bin/bridgetown cy:test

# Runs the Cypress tests headlessly in the Electron browser.
bin/bridgetown cy:run
```
