The Bridgetown gem makes the `bridgetown` executable available to you in your terminal. In a site project, a binstub is provided in the `bin` folder so you can execute `bin/bridgetown` and ensure you're using the correct version of Bridgetown as specified in your `Gemfile`.

You can use this command in a number of ways:

* `bridgetown new PATH` - Creates a new Bridgetown site at the specified path with a default configuration and typical site folder structure. Use the `--apply=` or `-a` option to [apply an automation](/docs/automations) to the new site.
* `bridgetown start` - Boots the Rack-based server (using Puma)â€”and in development, load build processes in the background along with Browsersync.
* `bridgetown deploy` - Ensures that all frontend assets get built alongside the published Bridgetown output. This is the command you'll want to use for ([Jamstack deployments](/docs/deployment)).
* `bridgetown build` or `bridgetown b` - Performs a single build of your site to the `output` folder (by default). Add the `-w` flag to also regenerate the site whenever a source file changes.
* `bridgetown console` or `bridgetown c` - Opens up an IRB console and lets you
  inspect your site configuration and content "under the hood" using
  Bridgetown's native Ruby API.
* [`bridgetown plugins [list|cd]`](/docs/commands/plugins) - Display information about installed plugins or allow you to copy content out of gem-based plugins into your site folders.
* `bridgetown apply` - Run an [automation script](/docs/automations) for your existing site.
* `bridgetown configure CONFIGURATION` - Run a [bundled configuration](/docs/bundled-configurations) for your existing site. Invoke without arguments to see all available configurations.
* `bridgetown help` - Shows help, optionally for a given subcommand, e.g. `bridgetown help build`.
* `bridgetown doctor` - Outputs any deprecation or configuration issues.
* `bridgetown clean` - Removes all generated files: destination folder, metadata file, and Bridgetown caches.
* `bridgetown webpack ACTION` - Allows you to perform actions such as `update` on your project's Webpack configuration. Invoke without arguments to see all available actions.

To change Bridgetown's default build behavior have a look through the [configuration options](/docs/configuration).

For deployment, if you need to add an extra step to copy `output` to a web server or run some script post-build, putting that in the `deploy` task in your `Rakefile` is a good way to go.

Alos take a look at the `scripts` configuration in `package.json` which provides integration points with the Webpack frontend bundler.
