We've made it as easy as we could to get started with Bridgetown, but it helps to have a basic understanding of a few key aspects of the site build process so you know which tools to use for the right job. Websites using Bridgetown are built and deployed as atomic artifacts, but they can optionally provide dynamic routes via a secondary server process. This means the website your visitors will ultimately engage with was largely produced as a "snapshot in time"â€”the product of Bridgetown's build process. How does that process work? Let's find out!

## The Build Process

There's a relatively linear process which occurs every time you run a [build command](/docs/command-line-usage):

1. First, Bridgetown loads its internal Ruby APIs as well as any Ruby gems specified in the `bridgetown-plugins` group of your `Gemfile`.
1. Next, Bridgetown looks for a [configuration](/docs/configuration) file in your current working directory and uses that to instantiate a `site` object.
1. After loading the configuration, Bridgetown prepares the `site` object for loading the various types of [content in your site repository](/docs/structure), starting with [custom plugins](/docs/plugins) in the `plugins` folder.
1. Plugins are then granted the ability to [generate new content programmatically](/docs/plugins/external-apis) and define other features such as [Liquid tags](/docs/plugins/tags) or [Ruby helpers](/docs/plugins/helpers) (aka "shortcodes"). This is the point when you'd create blog posts and other resources from data provided by an external API for example.
1. Once plugins (if any) have loaded, Bridgetown starts systematically reading in files from the source folder (typically `src`):
  * [Layouts](/docs/layouts)
  * [Components](/docs/components)
  * [Data files](/docs/datafiles)
  * [Static files](/docs/static-files)
  * [Resources](/docs/resources)
  * Any gem-based plugins which supply their own layouts, components, and content via [Source Manifests](/docs/plugins/source-manifests).
1. Once all of the data structures for the entire website are in place, Bridgetown __renders__ all relevant content objects to prepare them for final output. This is when [Front Matter](/docs/front-matter) variables are made available to templates, any [Liquid](/docs/template-engines/liquid) or [Ruby](/docs/template-engines/erb-and-beyond) templates are processed, formats like [Markdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html) are converted to HTML, resources are placed within layout templates, and generally everything is finalized in its proper output format (HTML, JSON, images, PDFs, etc.).
1. The final step is to write everything to the destination folder (typically `output`). If all has gone well, that folder will contain a complete, fully-functioning website [which can be deployed](/docs/deployment) to any basic HTTP web server.

There's also a second sort of build process which occurs only in development when you run the server with the `bin/bridgetown start` command, called **fast refresh**. This is a **new feature in Bridgetown 2.0**. Prior to this, every time you would change a file (update a blog post, edit a template, replace an image file, fix a bug in a custom plugin, etc.), that _entire build process_ would be run through again. As you can imagine, for really large sites with thousands of pages, build processes can slow down substantially.

Fast refresh uses a pair of techniques called _signals_ and _effects_ to track changes to individuals files and the ways in which data can flow across multiple files. In not all, but in most cases, this results in a much faster rebuild time. If you edit just a single resource file, it's likely only that one resource will get rebuilt. If you edit a [data file](/docs/datafiles) referenced on several pages using `site.signals`, those those several pages will get rebuilt. Fast refresh also tracks access to components within templates. [Read our original announcement blog post](/future/road-to-bridgetown-2.0-fast-refresh/) for a deep dive into this functionality.

{%@ Note do %}
If you find you are having issues with fast refresh in development, you can set `fast_refresh false` in your `config/initializers.rb` file. We also encourage you to submit a bug report if you can reproduce a particular sequence of events where it's not working.
{% end %}

## The Frontend Build Process

There's one aspect of the build process overlooked above: the compiling,
compressing, and bundling of [frontend assets](/docs/frontend-assets) like
JavaScript, CSS, web fonts, and so forth.

When using Bridgetown's built-in `start` or `deploy` commands,
essentially _two_ build processes are kicked off: the frontend build process (using esbuild) and the Bridgetown build process. The two align when something magical happens.

1. esbuild will conclude its build process by exporting a `manifest.json` file to the hidden `.bridgetown-cache` folder. This manifest lists the exact, fingerprinted filenames of the compiled and bundled JS and CSS output files.
1. Bridgetown, using the `asset_path` Liquid tag/Ruby helper, monitors that manifest, and whenever it detects a change it will regenerate the site to point to those bundled output files.
1. This way, your website frontend and the HTML of your generated static site are always kept in sync.

## Adding Extra Features to Your Site

In addition to the work you do yourself to code, design, and publish your website, there are ways you can enhance your site by installing third-party plugins or applying automations. These may provide new features, themes, or software configurations in useful ways. Some examples:

* Add instant search to your site with the [bridgetown-quick-search](https://github.com/bridgetownrb/bridgetown-quick-search) plugin
* Include inline SVG images with the [bridgetown-svg-inliner](https://github.com/ayushn21/bridgetown-svg-inliner) plugin

You can discover links to these and many more in our [Plugins directory](/plugins/).

## Server-Side Rendering and Dynamic Routes

For most content-rich websites intended for marketing, educational, or publishing purposes (blogs, etc.), a statically-built and deployed site may be all you need. But there may be times when you need a real backend running for your site, either to provide API endpoints your principal pages can communicate with via JavaScript, or to offer actual routes that are fully <abbr title="Server-Side Rendered">SSR'd</abbr>.

Bridgetown provides a [full SSR pipeline powered by the Roda web toolkit](/docs/routes). Roda, like Rails or Sinatra, takes full advantage of Ruby's Rack ecosystem and offers a minimalist yet elegant <abbr title="Domain-Specific Language">DSL</abbr> for defining and handling routes via a "routing tree" as well as processing request/response cycles. Accepting form data or JSON payloads is a snap, and there's even a core plugin you can configure to enable dynamic, file-based routing with all of Bridgetown's template engines and component rendering at your disposal.
