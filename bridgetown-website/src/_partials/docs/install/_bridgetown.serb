## Install Bridgetown

Now all that is left is to install Bridgetown!

{%- if site.data.edge_version %}
```
gem install bridgetown -N -v {{ Bridgetown::VERSION }}
```
{%- else %}
```
gem install bridgetown -N
```
{%- end %}

Create a new Bridgetown site at `./mysite`, as well as run `bundle install` and
`yarn install` automatically:

```sh
bridgetown new mysite

cd mysite
```

Now you should be able to build the site and run a live-reload server:

```sh
bin/bridgetown start
```

Try opening the site up in [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000){:target="_blank"}. See something? Awesome, you're ready to roll! If not, try revisiting your installation and setup steps, and if all else fails, [reach out to the Bridgetown community for support](/community/).
